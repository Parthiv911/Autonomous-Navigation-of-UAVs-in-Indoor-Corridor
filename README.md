"test_bench.ipynb" contains the results of the research.
Due to the large number of images and detailed nature of logs, the .ipynb file must be downloaded to be opened.

"test_data.h5" contains the Rotational Deviation Test Split obtained from the nitrUAVCorridorV1 dataset [https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/docs/CS/Database/Dataset%20for%20UAV%20Navigation%20inside%20corridor%20environments.htm]

"utility.py" contains the Solution class. The Solution class contains the code to identify areas of greatest depth, select the suitable area and generate flight commands.
